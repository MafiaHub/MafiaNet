    Cross-platform network engine written in C++ and specifically designed for games.<br/>
    Based on RakNet and SLikeNet
</div>

## History

MafiaNet is a fork of SLikeNet, which itself was a continuation of RakNet, a network engine with over 13 years of active development. RakNet, originally developed by Jenkins Software LLC, was acquired by Oculus VR in 2014 and open-sourced. When development stagnated, SLikeSoft created SLikeNet to continue RakNet's legacy, implementing various bug fixes, security improvements, and modernizing the codebase to support newer compilers and language features.

## Introduction

Now, as SLikeNet itself is no longer maintained, MafiaNet continues this legacy by providing an actively maintained, modern networking solution for games and similar applications. MafiaNet maintains the core functionality while modernizing the codebase further, implementing new features, and ensuring compatibility with current development standards and security practices.

The engine supports Windows, Linux, and Mac as primary platforms, with limited support for iOS, Android, and Windows Phone. It is designed specifically for games and applications with similar networking requirements, providing a robust foundation for multiplayer game development.
